## Analyzing Patient Outcomes in Hospitals: A Data-Driven Approach
---
### Project Description
#### This project uses data analysis and visualisation techniques to investigate the factors influencing hospital patient outcomes. The dataset contains information on patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment options, and outcome measures (e.g., length of stay, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction).
