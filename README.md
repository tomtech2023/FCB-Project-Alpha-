## Analyzing Patient Outcomes in Hospitals: A Data-Driven Approach
### Project Description
This project aims to investigate the factors influencing patient outcomes in hospitals using data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset contains information on patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment options, and outcome measures (e.g., length of stay, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction).
### Objective
1. Explore the relationship between patient characteristics and outcomes
2. Identify high-risk patient groups and potential areas for quality improvement
3. Develop predictive models to forecast patient outcomes
4. Create interactive dashboards to visualize findings and facilitate hospital-wide decision-making
