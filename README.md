## Analyzing Patient Outcomes in Hospitals: A Data-Driven Approach
### Project Description
This project aims to investigate the factors influencing patient outcomes in hospitals using data analysis and visualization techniques. The dataset contains information on patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment options, and outcome measures (e.g., length of stay, readmission rates, and patient satisfaction).
### Objective
1. Explore the relationship between patient characteristics and outcomes
2. Identify high-risk patient groups and potential areas for quality improvement
3. Develop predictive models to forecast patient outcomes
4. Create interactive dashboards to visualize findings and facilitate hospital-wide decision-making
### Tools and Technologies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) 
- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) (Data Modeling, Visualization, Dashboarding)
- [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) (Data Cleaning, Preprocessing)
### Deliverables
1. Data wrangling and preprocessing script (Python)
2. Exploratory data analysis report (PDF)
3. Predictive modeling script (Python)
4. Interactive Power BI dashboard (PBIX file)
### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in improving patient outcomes and hospital efficiency. By applying data-driven insights, healthcare professionals can optimize treatment strategies, reduce costs, and enhance patient care.
