The meeting continued with the coordinator informing us that we would be supporting the junior church and we’ll also join them in any programs they’ll have. He continued by telling us that we will be reviving our monthly meeting and asked sis Falade Favor to help us get the Osun province 5 calender in order to fix our monthly meetings. He continued by saying that he’s goings to inform pastors about our monthly meeting so they can bring representatives along with them and also keep us in mind in their plan.
